cd otto

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..

cd ..
```

### Required Configurations

**Server (`server/.env`):**
Create a `.env` file in the `/server/` directory with the following (replace placeholders with your actual keys):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback # Or your deployed server callback
SESSION_SECRET=a_very_strong_random_secret_for_sessions # Generate a strong random string
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Or your deployed client URL
```

**Firebase (`server/serviceAccountKey.json`):**
Place the `serviceAccountKey.json` file you downloaded from Firebase into the `/server/` directory. The content should look like this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "...",
  "token_uri": "...",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "...",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "...",
  "universe_domain": "..."
}
```

**Client (`client/.env.local` or `client/.env`):**
Create a `.env.local` (or `.env`) file in the `client/` directory. You'll need your Firebase project's client-side configuration.
   - In the Firebase Console, go to "Project settings".
   - Under "Your apps", if you haven't registered a web app, click the web icon (`</>`) to "Add app".
   - Give your app a nickname (e.g., "Otto Client") and click "Register app".
   - Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy these values.
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_from_config
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain_from_config
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_from_config
